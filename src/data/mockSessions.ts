      characters: ['Jay Gatsby', 'Daisy Buchanan', 'Nick Carraway', 'Tom Buchanan', 'Jordan Baker', 'Myrtle Wilson', 'George Wilson', 'Meyer Wolfsheim'],
      synopsis: `Set in the summer of 1922, "The Great Gatsby" follows the life of mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his obsession with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Narrator Nick Carraway, Daisy's cousin and Gatsby's neighbor, becomes drawn into their world of wealth, power, and deceit. Years before, Gatsby and Daisy had a romantic relationship, but Daisy married Tom Buchanan while Gatsby was serving in World War I. Gatsby has spent the years since amassing a fortune through dubious means, all to win back Daisy's love. He purchases a mansion across the bay from her home and throws extravagant parties hoping she might attend. When Nick arranges a reunion between Gatsby and Daisy, they begin an affair. Meanwhile, Tom has his own affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of garage owner George Wilson. The tensions come to a head during a confrontation in a New York hotel room, where Gatsby demands that Daisy tell Tom she never loved him. Daisy cannot bring herself to say this, and the group disperses. While driving Gatsby's car back from the city, Daisy strikes and kills Myrtle, but Gatsby takes responsibility for the accident. George, believing Gatsby to be both Myrtle's lover and her killer, shoots Gatsby in his pool before taking his own life. Despite Gatsby's lavish parties, almost no one attends his funeral except Nick. Nick, disillusioned with the moral emptiness of the wealthy, arranges the funeral before deciding to leave the East Coast. The novel ends with Nick reflecting on Gatsby's unwavering hope and the impossibility of recapturing the past, symbolized by the green light at the end of Daisy's dock that Gatsby would gaze at longingly.`,
      easterEgg: 'The green light at the end of Daisy\'s dock represents Gatsby\'s hopes and dreams, and appears as the novel\'s final image, suggesting the persistent American belief in possibility and a better future.'

      characters: ['Scout Finch', 'Atticus Finch', 'Jem Finch', 'Boo Radley', 'Tom Robinson', 'Calpurnia', 'Aunt Alexandra', 'Bob Ewell', 'Mayella Ewell', 'Dill Harris'],
      synopsis: `Set in the racially charged Depression-era South of the 1930s in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, "To Kill a Mockingbird" is narrated by Jean Louise "Scout" Finch, a young girl who lives with her older brother Jem and their widowed father, Atticus, a respected lawyer. The novel spans three years, during which Scout and Jem, along with their friend Dill, become fascinated with their reclusive neighbor, Arthur "Boo" Radley, who is the subject of local superstition. Meanwhile, Atticus is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Despite clear evidence of Tom's innocence, the all-white jury convicts him, revealing the town's deep-seated racial prejudice. After the trial, Tom attempts to escape from prison and is shot dead. Mayella's father, Bob Ewell, feels humiliated by the trial, as Atticus exposed him as a liar and suggested that he beat his daughter. Seeking revenge, Ewell attacks Scout and Jem as they walk home from a school Halloween pageant. During the attack, Boo Radley, who has secretly watched over the children for years, emerges from his seclusion and saves them by killing Ewell. To protect Boo from the publicity of a trial, the sheriff declares that Ewell fell on his own knife. Scout finally meets Boo and realizes he is a gentle soul, and she regrets that they never thanked him for the gifts he had secretly left for them. As Atticus tucks her into bed, Scout summarizes her newfound understanding by saying that hurting Boo would be "like shootin' a mockingbird," referring to her father's earlier lesson that it is a sin to kill mockingbirds because they only bring beauty and joy to the world. The novel is a poignant exploration of racial injustice, moral growth, empathy, and the loss of innocence.`,

      characters: ['Winston Smith', 'Julia', 'O\'Brien', 'Big Brother', 'Emmanuel Goldstein', 'Syme', 'Mr. Charrington', 'Parsons'],
      synopsis: `In the dystopian society of Oceania in the year 1984, Winston Smith works at the Ministry of Truth, rewriting historical records to conform to the state\'s ever-changing version of history. Winston lives under the constant surveillance of the Thought Police and the watchful eye of Big Brother, the symbolic leader of the totalitarian Party. Winston secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He begins writing a diary, an act punishable by death, and wanders into a prole neighborhood where he purchases an antique coral paperweight from Mr. Charrington\'s shop. Winston begins an illicit affair with Julia, a young woman who shares his hatred for the Party, though her rebellion is more instinctual than ideological. They rent a room above Mr. Charrington\'s shop, where they believe they can escape surveillance. Winston is approached by O\'Brien, an Inner Party member whom Winston believes is part of a secret resistance movement called the Brotherhood, led by the state\'s enemy, Emmanuel Goldstein. O\'Brien gives Winston "The Book," supposedly written by Goldstein, which explains how the Party maintains power. However, Winston and Julia are arrested in their rented room; Mr. Charrington reveals himself as a member of the Thought Police. Winston is taken to the Ministry of Love, where O\'Brien reveals he has been deceiving Winston and is a loyal Party member. O\'Brien tortures Winston to cure him of his "insanity" – his resistance to the Party\'s ideology. The final stage of Winston\'s "rehabilitation" occurs in the dreaded Room 101, where he is confronted with his worst fear: rats. Winston finally betrays Julia by begging that her body be substituted for his. With his spirit broken, Winston is released back into society. He encounters Julia, and both confess to betraying each other. Winston sits in the Chestnut Tree Café, listening to the telescreen announce Oceania\'s victory in a war, and realizes he now loves Big Brother. The novel serves as a warning about the dangers of totalitarianism, thought control, and the manipulation of truth.`,
      easterEgg: 'The recurring phrase "Under the spreading chestnut tree, I sold you and you sold me" is a corrupted version of a traditional English song, symbolizing how the Party corrupts everything, even love and memory.'

      synopsis: `Set in early 19th-century England, "Pride and Prejudice" centers on the Bennet family, particularly the second eldest daughter Elizabeth. With five unmarried daughters and an entailed estate that will pass to a male cousin upon Mr. Bennet\'s death, Mrs. Bennet is anxious to see her daughters married well. When wealthy bachelor Mr. Bingley arrives in the neighborhood, he takes an immediate interest in the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane. Bingley\'s friend, the even wealthier and more reserved Mr. Darcy, initially snubs Elizabeth at a local ball, describing her as "tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me." This slight ignites Elizabeth\'s prejudice against him. Meanwhile, Jane and Bingley grow closer until Bingley abruptly leaves for London, breaking Jane\'s heart. Elizabeth believes Darcy influenced this decision. Elizabeth meets the charming officer George Wickham, who claims he was deprived of an inheritance by Darcy, further cementing her dislike. When Elizabeth visits her friend Charlotte Lucas, who has pragmatically married the Bennets\' cousin Mr. Collins, she encounters Darcy again at his aunt\'s estate. To her shock, Darcy proposes marriage, admitting he loves her despite her inferior social connections. Elizabeth angrily rejects him, citing his role in separating Jane and Bingley and his alleged mistreatment of Wickham. In a letter, Darcy explains that he believed Jane indifferent to Bingley and reveals Wickham\'s true character: he had attempted to elope with Darcy\'s fifteen-year-old sister for her fortune. Gradually, Elizabeth\'s opinion of Darcy begins to change. During a tour with her aunt and uncle, Elizabeth visits Pemberley, Darcy\'s estate, where she learns from his servants that he is a generous landlord and master. Unexpectedly meeting Darcy there, she is surprised by his gentlemanly behavior. Their renewed acquaintance is interrupted by news that Lydia, Elizabeth\'s youngest sister, has eloped with Wickham. Believing this scandal ends any chance with Darcy, Elizabeth returns home. Eventually, Lydia and Wickham are found and married, saving the family\'s reputation. Elizabeth later learns it was Darcy who found the couple and paid Wickham to marry Lydia, motivated by his love for her. Bingley returns and proposes to Jane, while Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Darcy\'s aunt, visits Elizabeth to forbid a match with her nephew. Elizabeth refuses to promise not to marry him, and her spirited defense encourages Darcy to propose again. This time, Elizabeth accepts, having overcome her prejudice and recognized Darcy\'s true nature beyond his initially proud demeanor. The novel concludes with the happy marriages of Elizabeth and Darcy, and Jane and Bingley.`,
      easterEgg: 'Mr. Darcy\'s first name, Fitzwilliam, is rarely mentioned in the novel and is actually his mother\'s family name, highlighting the importance of maternal lineage despite the patriarchal inheritance system central to the plot.'

      characters: ['Holden Caulfield', 'Phoebe Caulfield', 'Allie Caulfield', 'D.B. Caulfield', 'Stradlater', 'Ackley', 'Jane Gallagher', 'Sally Hayes', 'Mr. Antolini', 'Maurice', 'Sunny'],
      synopsis: `"The Catcher in the Rye" follows 16-year-old Holden Caulfield after his expulsion from Pencey Prep School for poor academic performance. Rather than returning home immediately to face his parents, Holden decides to spend a few days alone in New York City. The novel is told as a first-person narrative from a mental health facility where Holden is recovering from an unspecified breakdown. Holden\'s narrative begins with his final day at Pencey, where he gets into a fight with his roommate Stradlater over a girl named Jane Gallagher, whom Holden cares for deeply. After leaving Pencey, Holden checks into the Edmont Hotel in New York City, where he spends time reflecting on his younger brother Allie, who died of leukemia years earlier—a loss that continues to haunt him. During his time in the city, Holden experiences a series of encounters: he dances with three tourist women in a nightclub, hires a prostitute named Sunny but ends up just talking with her, gets beaten by her pimp Maurice, goes on a date with an old flame named Sally Hayes, and gets drunk in various bars. Throughout these experiences, Holden reveals his deep cynicism toward what he perceives as the phoniness of the adult world, while simultaneously displaying his own insecurities, contradictions, and emotional fragility. Holden secretly visits his sister Phoebe at his parents\' apartment while they are out, and she challenges his aimlessness, asking what he wants to do with his life. In response, Holden shares his fantasy of being "the catcher in the rye"—someone who protects children playing in a rye field from falling off a cliff, a metaphor for preserving innocence. After visiting his former teacher Mr. Antolini, who offers him advice and a place to stay (though Holden misinterprets a gesture from him as a sexual advance), Holden decides to run away. Before leaving, he arranges to meet Phoebe at the Museum of Art. When she arrives with a suitcase, wanting to go with him, Holden is moved by her devotion but realizes he cannot take her away. Instead, they go to the Central Park Zoo, where watching Phoebe ride the carousel in the rain brings Holden a rare moment of peace and happiness. The novel ends with Holden hinting that he returned home, got "sick," and is now in a mental institution in California, where he is receiving therapy. He expresses ambivalence about returning to school but suggests he might apply himself more when he returns. The novel is a powerful exploration of teenage alienation, identity, loss of innocence, and the painful process of growing up.`,
      easterEgg: 'Holden\'s red hunting hat, which he frequently mentions throughout the novel, symbolizes both his alienation from society and his desire to protect innocence (connecting to his "catcher in the rye" fantasy), as its color echoes his siblings Allie and Phoebe\'s red hair.'

      characters: ['Ishmael', 'Captain Ahab', 'Queequeg', 'Starbuck', 'Stubbs', 'Flask', 'Pip', 'Fedallah', 'Moby Dick', 'Captain Boomer', 'Perth', 'Tashtego', 'Daggoo'],
      synopsis: `"Moby-Dick" begins with the famous line "Call me Ishmael," introducing the narrator who seeks adventure and escape from depression by joining a whaling voyage. In Nantucket, Ishmael meets Queequeg, a harpooner from the South Pacific with whom he forms a close friendship. They join the crew of the Pequod, a whaling ship commanded by the mysterious Captain Ahab. After the ship sets sail, Ahab finally appears on deck and reveals his true purpose for the voyage: to hunt and kill Moby Dick, the legendary white sperm whale that had previously bitten off Ahab\'s leg. Ahab nails a gold doubloon to the mast as a reward for the first man to spot the whale, inflaming the crew\'s desire to hunt Moby Dick. As the Pequod sails around Africa and into the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the novel alternates between the unfolding narrative of the hunt and encyclopedic chapters detailing whaling techniques, cetology (the study of whales), and philosophical musings. The ship encounters various other vessels with their own stories related to Moby Dick, including the Goney, the Town-Ho, the Virgin, the Jeroboam (whose mate had predicted doom for anyone who hunted the white whale), the Samuel Enderby (captained by a man who lost an arm to Moby Dick but wisely chose not to pursue revenge), and the Rachel, which is searching for its captain\'s son lost at sea. Throughout the voyage, Ahab\'s obsession intensifies, despite warnings and the growing concern of his chief mate Starbuck, who considers killing Ahab to end the dangerous quest. Ahab is aided by a shadowy crew of Asian harpooners led by Fedallah, who prophesies that Ahab will die only after seeing two hearses, one not made by human hands and one made of American wood, and that only hemp can kill him. After three days of chasing Moby Dick, the whale attacks and destroys the Pequod\'s whaling boats. On the third day, Moby Dick rams the ship itself, which sinks with all hands except Ishmael. Ahab, caught in the line of his own harpoon thrown at Moby Dick, is dragged into the sea. Fedallah\'s prophecies are fulfilled: the two hearses are Fedallah\'s body lashed to the whale (not made by human hands) and the sinking Pequod (made of American wood), and the hemp that kills Ahab is the rope of his own harpoon. Ishmael survives by floating on Queequeg\'s coffin, which had been converted into a life buoy, and is rescued by the Rachel. The novel serves as a complex exploration of obsession, fate, the nature of evil, and humanity\'s relationship with the natural world.`,
      easterEgg: 'The character Bulkington, who is introduced early in the novel with significant detail suggesting he would be important to the story, almost completely disappears after the first few chapters, leading to speculation that Melville originally had a larger role planned for him but changed course during the writing process.'

      synopsis: `"The Lord of the Rings" begins in the Shire, where the hobbit Frodo Baggins inherits the One Ring from his cousin Bilbo. The wizard Gandalf discovers this ring is actually the master ring forged by the Dark Lord Sauron centuries ago to control all the Rings of Power and dominate Middle-earth. Sauron\'s essence is bound to the Ring, and he has now risen again in Mordor, seeking its return. To prevent Sauron from reclaiming his full power, Frodo must undertake a perilous journey to destroy the Ring in Mount Doom, the volcano in Mordor where it was created—the only place it can be unmade. At the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, a fellowship is formed to aid Frodo in his quest: his hobbit friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; the wizard Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn and Boromir; the elf Legolas; and the dwarf Gimli. Their journey takes them through the Mines of Moria, where Gandalf falls into shadow battling a Balrog. The Fellowship then travels to the elven realm of Lothlórien before the group splinters near Amon Hen. Boromir, briefly corrupted by desire for the Ring, attempts to take it from Frodo, who decides to continue the quest alone. Sam insists on accompanying him, while Merry and Pippin are captured by orcs who believe they have the Ring. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the orcs to rescue the hobbits. Frodo and Sam are later joined by Gollum, the Ring\'s former bearer, who guides them to Mordor while secretly planning to reclaim his "precious." Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli encounter the resurrected Gandalf the White. They assist in the war against Sauron\'s ally Saruman and later help defend the kingdom of Gondor from Sauron\'s armies. Merry and Pippin, after escaping the orcs, help mobilize the Ents, ancient tree-shepherds, against Saruman and later participate in the war. Aragorn claims his heritage as the rightful king of Gondor and leads a desperate attack on the Black Gate of Mordor to distract Sauron, allowing Frodo and Sam to reach Mount Doom. At the Crack of Doom, Frodo ultimately fails to resist the Ring\'s power and claims it for himself. However, Gollum attacks him, bites off his finger with the Ring, and in his ecstatic celebration, falls into the fire with the Ring, inadvertently completing the quest. With the Ring\'s destruction, Sauron is vanquished forever, his armies are defeated, and his realm collapses. The surviving members of the Fellowship are reunited, and Aragorn is crowned King of the Reunited Kingdom. The hobbits return to the Shire, which they must liberate from ruffians controlled by Saruman. Eventually, still bearing the spiritual wounds of his quest, Frodo departs Middle-earth with the elves and Gandalf for the Undying Lands, leaving Sam, now married with children, to continue the story in the restored Shire.`,
      easterEgg: 'The tale of Beren and Lúthien, which Aragorn recounts early in the story, parallels his own romance with Arwen (only briefly mentioned in the main text but detailed in the appendices), and was inspired by Tolkien\'s relationship with his wife, even appearing on their shared tombstone with their real names.'

      synopsis: `"The Chronicles of Narnia" is a series of seven fantasy novels that center on the magical land of Narnia, created by the great lion Aslan and filled with talking animals and mythical creatures. The series begins chronologically with "The Magician\'s Nephew," where young Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer discover magical rings that transport them to different worlds. They witness Aslan\'s creation of Narnia and inadvertently bring the evil Queen Jadis (later the White Witch) into the new world. Digory retrieves an apple from a distant garden to protect Narnia and plants its seed, which grows into a tree whose wood will later become the wardrobe featured in the most famous book of the series. In "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," the four Pevensie children—Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy—discover Narnia by entering through a magical wardrobe in the professor\'s house (the now elderly Digory Kirke). They find Narnia under the spell of the White Witch, who has cursed the land with eternal winter. Edmund betrays his siblings by allying with the Witch for Turkish Delight, but Aslan sacrifices himself to save Edmund, breaking the deep magic and resurrecting to help defeat the Witch. The children become kings and queens of Narnia for years before accidentally returning to England, where no time has passed. In "The Horse and His Boy," a story set during the Pevensies\' reign, a boy named Shasta and a girl named Aravis escape from the southern land of Calormen with two talking horses to reach freedom in Narnia, uncovering and foiling a Calormene invasion plan. "Prince Caspian" finds the Pevensies drawn back to Narnia, where centuries have passed and their reign has become legend. They help the rightful heir, Prince Caspian, overthrow his usurping uncle Miraz, who has suppressed the Old Narnians (talking animals and mythical creatures). At the end, Peter and Susan learn they are too old to return to Narnia. In "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader," Edmund, Lucy, and their disagreeable cousin Eustace join Caspian on a sea voyage to the edge of the world. Eustace undergoes a transformation after being turned into a dragon, and they encounter various islands and adventures while searching for seven lost lords. In "The Silver Chair," a reformed Eustace and his schoolmate Jill Pole are called to Narnia to find the missing Prince Rilian, Caspian\'s son, who has been enchanted by a witch. With the help of the gloomy but faithful Marsh-wiggle Puddleglum, they free Rilian from the underground kingdom where he has been held captive. The series concludes with "The Last Battle," where a false Aslan is used to corrupt Narnia. King Tirian, the last monarch of Narnia, with help from Eustace and Jill, fights against the deception. The world of Narnia ends, and Aslan leads the faithful to his country, the "true Narnia." The Pevensies (except Susan, who no longer believes in Narnia) and their friends discover they have died in their own world and now exist eternally in Aslan\'s country, where "every chapter is better than the one before." Throughout the series, Aslan serves as a Christ-like figure, guiding and redeeming the children and Narnia itself, with the stories forming an allegory of Christian themes and values.`,
      easterEgg: 'Despite appearing in chronological order as the sixth book, "The Magician\'s Nephew" was actually the second-to-last Narnia book that C.S. Lewis wrote, which explains why it contains so many origin explanations that enhance the reading of the earlier-published books, such as how the wardrobe became magical and why the lamp-post stands in the middle of Narnian woods.'

      characters: ['John the Savage', 'Lenina Crowne', 'Bernard Marx', 'Helmholtz Watson', 'Mustapha Mond', 'Linda', 'Tomakin', 'Fanny Crowne', 'Henry Foster'],
      synopsis: `Set in the year 2540 (632 A.F.—"After Ford"), "Brave New World" depicts a technologically advanced global society where human reproduction has been industrialized. The World State has eliminated natural reproduction, instead growing babies in "hatcheries" where they are genetically engineered to fit into one of five predetermined social castes, from the highly intelligent Alphas to the semi-moron Epsilons. Children are conditioned through sleep-teaching (hypnopaedia) and behavioral engineering to accept their social destiny, embrace consumerism, engage in recreational sex, and consume the mood-altering drug soma to maintain happiness and social stability. The novel follows Bernard Marx, an Alpha Plus psychologist who feels like an outsider due to his smaller stature and unorthodox views. He takes Lenina Crowne, a woman he desires, to a Savage Reservation in New Mexico, where they meet Linda, a woman from the World State who was accidentally left behind years ago while pregnant, and her son John, known as "the Savage." Bernard realizes John is the son of the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning (DHC), who had previously threatened to exile Bernard to Iceland. Bernard brings John and Linda back to London, humiliating the DHC, who resigns in disgrace. John, raised on Shakespeare and an odd mixture of Native American traditions and Linda\'s memories of the World State, initially becomes a celebrity. However, he is increasingly repulsed by the shallow, hedonistic society. He falls in love with Lenina but is conflicted about his physical desire for her, viewing it as sinful based on his upbringing. When Linda dies from years of soma consumption, John\'s grief—a natural emotion that the society has eliminated—is incomprehensible to onlookers. John\'s disillusionment reaches its peak when he attempts to disrupt the distribution of soma to Delta workers, resulting in a riot. He, Bernard, and Bernard\'s friend Helmholtz Watson are brought before Mustapha Mond, the World Controller for Western Europe. Mond explains that stability and happiness have been prioritized over truth, beauty, and freedom. Bernard and Helmholtz are exiled to remote islands where unorthodox thinkers can live freely among their peers. John, however, asks to go somewhere truly challenging—somewhere with the freedom to be unhappy. Mond refuses, seeing John as an experiment. John retreats to an abandoned lighthouse to live as a hermit, practicing self-flagellation as penance for his perceived sins. Sensation-seeking crowds discover him and turn his solitude into a spectacle. After Lenina visits, triggering a violent emotional response from John, he participates in a soma-fueled orgy and, overcome with self-loathing, hangs himself the next morning. The novel serves as a warning about the dehumanizing effects of technological progress, mass consumption, and the sacrifice of individual freedom and authentic human experience for the sake of social stability and engineered happiness.`,
      easterEgg: 'The title "Brave New World" is ironically drawn from Shakespeare\'s "The Tempest," where Miranda, seeing other humans for the first time, exclaims "O brave new world, that has such people in\'t!"—words John the Savage repeats throughout the novel, first with wonder and later with bitter disillusionment.'
